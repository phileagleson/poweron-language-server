\n   This is your standard IRA plan. The IRA Share record is not part of a SEP plan and does not use an IRS plan for matching with this IRS record.##### 1â€“99
\n   The IRA Share record is part of a SEP plan and uses this IRS plan (defined by your financial institution) for matching with this IRS record.
\n   
\n       - Symitar suggests that you select unique IRS Plan numbers for each kind of plan you offer that must be reported separately. For example, you can set up all IRA Share records under the SEP plan with a value of 01 in this field, then set up all regular IRA Share records with a value of 00 in this field.
\nThe primary purpose of this field is to distinguish between IRA Share records that are part of a Simplified Employer Pension (SEP) plan (the IRS Code field set to (03) SEP) and IRA Share records that are not part of a SEP plan, by connecting specific Share records to a particular IRS record. Whenever the system accumulates contribution and distribution amounts in IRS records, it determines which IRS record to use based on the following matching criteria:
\n   - The Taxpayer ID field in the IRS record must match the effective SSN for the Share record.
\n   - The IRS Code field in the IRS record must match the IRS Code field in the Share record.
\n   - The IRS Plan field in the IRS record must match the IRS Plan field in the Share record.
\n
\nTherefore, the combination of the values in the SSN, IRS Code, and IRS Plan fields should be unique for every IRS record in an account. If your financial institution uses IRS plans, this field lets you have more than one IRA plan in each member account. Each is reported separately to the IRS. The IRS Reporting batch program does not consolidate information from two or more shares or IRS records or accounts if the values in the IRS Plan fields are different.

\n   - You use the Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) edit run with the Oldest Beneficiary is Spouse field of the IRA RMD Recalculation Info Tracking record set to (0) No.
\nSo that the system can use this field in IRS-related calculations, enter the birth date of the IRS holder's spouse for HSA Share records. The system checks the date in this field for two reasons:
\n   - To determine if the IRS holder's spouse is eligible for a spousal catch-up contribution (an additional elective deferral made by eligible participants aged 55 or over).
\n
\n   - If you enter a date here, the system calculates the spousal contribution, depending on the spouse's age. If you do not enter a date, the system does not calculate a spousal catch-up contribution to this share.

A member or the member's spouse, who is 55 or older, can make a catch-up contribution, if eligible. If a member's spouse is 55 or older, the amount of their catch-up contribution must be reported under the spouse's SSN.
