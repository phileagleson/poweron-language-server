\nDefault Control      **Yes**
\nDefault Value **<Blank>**
\n
\nEnter the two-digit suffix to the card number, if any. The two most common uses for a suffix are:
\nFor internal tracking only, you can type a unique suffix to identify each card (for example, 01 for the first card, 02 for the second card, etc.). The card suffix is not part of the Card Number field and is not encoded on the card, but may be useful when designing PowerOn specfiles.
\n   - ATM cards may use a suffix if you issue several cards for the same value in the Card Number field, but want the cards to be treated separately. The suffix is used for card verification. For example, if the ATM card with suffix 01 is captured and further authorizations will be denied, the ATM card with the same card number and suffix 02 can still be used. The suffix may be part of the card number or may be embossed on the card separately and included in the Track II data in the card's magnetic stripe.
\n***Important:***  In the ATM environment, the industry standard recognizes a one-character suffix, also referred to as "member number" or "plastic number".
\n
\nThis field is not supported in merchant, signature, or credit card environments.

\nHelp File            **00805**
\nDefault Control      **Yes**
\nDefault Value **0**
\n
\nRequired entry: Select one of the following values:
\n#### Data Type Descriptions
\n##### (0) Not issued
\n   The card has not been issued. If Symitar issues new cards automatically, you should select this option when you create the Card record, then you should not revise this field. Symitar updates this field with the appropriate value when you perform a card issuance edit run.##### (1) Issued
\n   The card has been issued. If your credit union issues new cards manually, you should select this option after you issue the card.
\n       - Important: Only cards with this status can be used in the online environment.
\n##### (2) Capture
\n   The card has been issued, but transactions should be denied the next time it is used. Some ATM processors/units can physically capture the card when it is next used in an ATM. For credit and debit cards, this option is for informational purposes only, and Symitar does not physically capture the card. You must capture credit and debit cards manually.
\n   
\n       - During a card blocking transaction, if it is supported by the ATM network (for example, CO-OPSM Financial Services), Symitar updates this field to this option when the member incorrectly enters his or her PIN too many times and the maximum value in the ATM configuration file is met.
\n
\nSymitar maintains the value in this field. It also allows ATM network software to update this field whenever that software makes an automatic change affecting it. Under normal circumstances you should not revise this field.
\n***Important:***  The CPS online authorization software is designed to return specific CPS response codes based on the value in the Block Code field, which takes precedence over this field. This feature automatically occurs for all CPS clients. For further information, see Response Code Out.
\n
\nIf you have the add-on module for automated hot carding, when Symitar receives a file update message from your ATM network processor, Symitar updates this field in all matching Card records. The query includes the Card Suffix if it is enabled for the specific card type.
`)
cardRecordFields.set("statusreason", ` 
\n### Status Reason
\nThis field stores a code that indicates why a card was set to (2) Capture status.
\nField Number         **079**
\nMnemonic             **STATUSREASON**
\nData Type            **Code to 199**
\nSource               **System-entered**
\nHelp File            **00879**
\nDefault Control      **No**
\nDefault Value **020**
\n
\nThis field lets ATM software translate an internal code to a network-specific code (often referred to as Block Code). This translation is useful in reporting a single card number to multiple networks with different block codes. The ATM network edit does not use this field unless the value in the Card Status field is set to (2) Capture.

\nReturn - Requested by Network***Important:***  If a card is hot-carded through an incoming Negative File Message from a network, this field is usually set to 020. A different result can occur for the following conditions:
\nIf the following are both true:
\nYour credit union is using the Falcon Fraud system
\nYour credit union has activated the Update Card Status Reason parameter in the Online Network Parameters for the jhaPassPort switch (or if your ATM Online Network Configurations are set to do so)
\n
\nThen the ATM software uses the Response Code from the incoming network negative file messages to automatically populate this field in the Card record according to the following:
\n
\nCO-OP/eFunds Network - Response Code	Symitar - Card Status Reason
\n41 - Permanent block/lost	001 - Retain-Lost
\n34 - Permanent block	003 - Pickup-Fraud
\n59 - Temporary block/suspected fraud	103 - Do Not Pickup-Fraud
\nIf the following are both true:
\nYour credit union is using jhaPassPort Direct, version 2008 or greater
\nYour credit union has activated the Update Card Status Reason parameter in the Online Network Parameters for the jhaPassPort.pro switch (or if your ATM Online Network Configurations are set to do so)
\n
\nThen the ATM software uses the Response Code from the incoming jhaPassPort Direct online negative file messages to automatically populate this field in the Card record according to the following:
\n
\njhaPassPort Direct - Response Code	Symitar - Card Status Reason
\n41 - Hot Card, lost card, pickup	001 - Retain-Lost
\n34 - Hot Card, suspected fraud, pickup	003 - Retain-Fraud
\n05 - Warm Card, do not honor	100 - Return No Reason Specified
\n59 - Warm Card, suspected fraud	103 - Return-Fraud
\n
\nThe value in this field is then used to automatically populate a specific Response Code in the jhaPassPort Card File (PPCF).
\n
\nIf the following are both true:
\nYour credit union is using the Fiserv EPOC ISO 8583 system
\nYour credit union has requested To Host Maintenance (THM) functionality with Fiserv EPOC
\n
\nThen the ATM software uses the Status value and the Capture Code fields from the incoming THM file update messages to automatically populate this field in the Card record according to the following:
\n
\nIf Fiserv EPOC ISO 8583 THM Status value equals	And Fiserv EPOC ISO 8583 THM Capture Code is 0, Symitar Status Reason equals	But if Fiserv EPOC ISO 8583 THM Capture Code is 1, Symitar Status Reason equals

\n
\nSymitar lets the ATM network software update this field whenever that software makes an automatic change affecting it.
\nIf your credit union has automated hot-carding, when this field changes on a captured card, Symitar either:
\nSends a file update message to your ATM network processor, if you have queuing enabled
\n   - Prompts you to send a file update message manually

\n### File Update Manager Exception
\nThis field stores a code that indicates whether the ATM File Update Manager software encounters an exception associated with the card data that it sent or received from the network and gives a general idea (status) about the reason. This indication applies to both high priority messages and messages sent in regular processing.
\nField Number         **093**

\nHelp File            **00893**
\nDefault Control      **No**
\nDefault Value **0**
\n
\n#### Data Type Descriptions
\n##### 0 No Exception
\n   There is no exception for the card.
\n       - Only the ATM File Update Manager can set this value for three potential reasons:
\n       - The ATM File Update Manager is not configured for this card type and does not send updates.
\n       - The ATM File Update Manager is configured for this card type but there is no exception for the card.
\n       - There was a problem with a different value previously but it has been fixed and the most recent update was successful.
\n##### 1 Update Requested by User
\n   The ATM File Update Manager sends an update for the card, usually after fixing an exception that prevented successful messages previously.
\n   
\n       - After the ATM File Update Manager sends the update, it changes the value depending on the outcome.
\n   
\n       - You can set this value manually, in a PowerOn specfile, or through a SymConnect or SymXchange interface.
\n##### 2 Deletion Requested by User
\n   The ATM File Update Manager sends a deletion request for the card to the network.
\n   
\n       - After the successful deletion, the ATM File Update Manager does not send further messages for the card.
\n   
\n       - You can set this value manually, in a PowerOn specfile, or through a SymConnect or SymXchange interface.
\n##### 3 Force Add Requested by User (PPS VIP ISO87 only)
\n   The ATM File Update Manager software sends an add request in an outgoing 0382 file update message to the CPS switch. Specifically, the ATM File Update Manager software sends 1 (Add) in the File Update Code message field when you select this option. This File Update Code message field value enables the ATM File Update Manager software to refresh the data in the CPS database with the data in the Symitar account database for a single card. This message field value also enables the CPS switch to do the following:
\n       - Add card data to the CPS database for cards that do no exist in the CPS database
\n       - Update card data in the CPS database if an add request is sent for a card that exists in the CPS database
\n   
\n       - When the ATM File Update Manager software receives the confirmation for the successful update from the online network, it updates the ATM File Update Manager database with the changed data and logs the file update request in the ATM File Update Manager Journal.
\n   
\n       - After the ATM File Update Manager sends the request to add, the value in this field changes depending on the outcome.
\n   
\n       - You can set this value manually, in a PowerOn specfile or through a SymConnect or SymXchange interface.
\n##### 4â€“9
\n   Not used.##### 10 Deleted per User Request
\n   The card was deleted successfully from the network as requested by the user (by previously setting this field to 2 Deletion Requested by User).
\n   
\n       - The ATM File Update Manager does not send further messages for the card.
\n   
\n       - Only the ATM File Update Manager can set this status after the request has been processed successfully.
\n##### 11 User Requested Deletion Failed
\n   The ATM File Update Manager tried to delete the card from the network as requested by the user (by setting this field to 2 Deletion Requested by User) and the request failed.
\n       - The ATM File Update Manager Exception report has more details. The ATM File Update Manager does not try to send another message for the card until you have reviewed the issue and have taken either of the following steps:
\n       - Manually changed this field to 2 Deletion Requested by User again, or 1 Update Requested by User if you changed your mind about the deletion.
\n       - Manually initiated a successful online file update by right-clicking the card in the Account Manager tree and selecting Send Online File Update. If you have set this field to 2 Deletion Requested by User at the time of the manual file update, the ATM File Update Manager sends another deletion request to the network.
\n   
\n       - Only the ATM File Update Manager can set this status.
\n##### 12 Deleted-Data Exception
\n   The ATM File Update Manager indicates that the card was deleted from the network because card or account data were modified in such a way that mandatory data cannot be sent to the network.
\n   
\n       - The ATM File Update Manager does not send further messages for the card until you fix the data exception.
\n   
\n       - Only the ATM File Update Manager can set this status.
\n##### 13 Deletion for Data Exception Failed
\n   The ATM File Update Manager tried to delete the card from the network because card or account data were modified in such a way that mandatory data cannot be sent to the network, but the request failed.
\n   
\n       - The ATM File Update Manager Exception report has more details. The ATM File Update Manager does not send further messages for the card until you fix the data exception.
\n   
\n       - Only the ATM File Update Manager can set this status.
\n##### 14 No Update-Rejected by Network
\n   The ATM File Update Manager sent a file update message for the card to the network, but the network has rejected the message.
\n       - The ATM File Update Manager does not send further messages for the card until you have reviewed the issue that caused the network to reject the message, made any necessary changes to fix it, and taken either of the following steps:
\n       - Manually changed this field to 1 Update Requested by User.
\n       - Manually initiated a successful online file update by right-clicking the card in the Account Manager tree and selecting Send Online File Update.
\n   
\n       - Only the ATM File Update Manager can set this status.
\n##### 15 Not Added (Or Deletion in Progress)-Data Exception
\n   The ATM File Update Manager does not send file update messages for a new card to the network because mandatory data is missing or incorrect. The network does not add the card to the networkâ€™s database.
\n   
\n       - The ATM File Update Manager does not send further messages for the card until you fix the data exception.
\n   
\n       - If the card is not new, this value indicates that the deletion of the card at the network is in progress. The ATM File Update Manager changes this field to 12 Deleted-Data Exception or 13 Deletion for Data Exception Failed when it processes the network response to the deletion request.
\n   
\n       - Only the ATM File Update Manager can set this status.
\n##### 16 To Be Deleted per User Request After Full Refresh Is Complete
\n   The ATM File Update Manager sets this value if you have requested the deletion (by setting this field to 2 Deletion Requested by User) and a full refresh was started before the ATM File Update Manager could delete the card during regular processing.
\n   
\n       - During a full refresh, the ATM File Update Manager cannot send deletion requests. This value indicates that the ATM File Update Manager sent the full card data during the full refresh, but will send a deletion request during regular processing after the full refresh is complete.
\n   
\n       - Only the ATM File Update Manager can set this status.

\n***Important:***  The CPS - PPS VIP ISO87 online authorization software is designed to deny transactions based on the value in this field. This feature automatically occurs for all CPS clients. The value in this field takes precedence over the value in the Card Status field, so if this field is set to L (Lost Account), even though the Card Status field is set to 1, transactions will be denied with a CPS denial reason of 43 and a Symitar response of Card Captured. Since other areas of the Symitar software look at the Card Status field and not the Block Code field, We recommend that you maintain the Card Status field along with the Status Reason Code field to ensure that CPS is notified of any cards that should be blocked for transaction processing while in stand-in. The following is a list of available block codes for PPS VIP ISO87 that causes a transaction to be declined regardless of the card's status:
\nBlock Codes	CPS Denial Reason Code	Our Response

\nFor manual entries:
\nWhen you open a Card record, the default for this field should be date null so that Symitar can fill in the system date. For procedures, see Card Defaults.
\n   - If you enter a date in this field manually, Symitar overrides the date you enter with the system date each time the card is reissued by a card issuance edit run.
\n   - You must enter an effective date before the value in the Expiration Date field. If you attempt to enter an effective date after the expiration date, Symitar displays the message:
\n   - Effective cannot be after expiration
\n   - Cards with an effective date greater than (after) the system date cannot be used in the online environment.

\nIf you leave this field blank (date null), Symitar resets the expiration date during each card issuance edit run that issues or reissues the card. The expiration date is usually the first of the month. For example, a card with a "good through" date of 12/49 would have an expiration date of 1/1/2050 in the Card record. In the online environment, a blank date indicates that the card never expires.
\nFor manual entries:
\nIf you enter a date in this field manually, the card issuance edit run does not reset the date, unless the date is outside the date limits set for the edit run. This could cause problems if your card processor uses preset expiration dates, so check with us before entering expiration dates manually.
