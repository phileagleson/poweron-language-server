\n#### Data Type Descriptions
\n##### (0) Level Payment
\n   This option indicates the system should calculate equal periodic segment payments. When this option is selected, the system does the following:
\n       - Calculates a payment schedule that pays off the segment in equal payments (principal + interest = the same amount each period)
\n       - Applies the standard payment amount first to the Interest Unpaid field amount, next to the Billed Fees Unpaid amount, and only then applies any remainder to the principal
\n   
\n       - The amount applied to the segment principal changes each period, since the amount of interest due each period depends on the segment balance and the number of days in the loan period. This is the normal option for most daily interest loans.
\n##### (1) Level Principal
\n   This option indicates the system should calculate segment payments so that the same amount is applied to the segment principal each period. When this option is selected, the system does the following:
\n       - Calculates a standard principal amount (Original Balance field value รท Payment Count field value) for each segment payment
\n       - Adds any unpaid interest to the payment amount
\n   
\n       - The total payment changes each period, since the amount of interest due each period depends on the segment balance and the number of days in the loan period. This option is often used for single payment loans, real estate loans, or interest-only payment loans (but not for daily billed interest-only loans).
\n
\nIf you pull this value from a loan calculation, the system updates this field with the value in the Payment Type field of the Loan Calc screen.

segmentRecordFields.set("balloondate", ` 
\n### Balloon Date
\nThis field contains the date a balloon segment payment comes due. Once the system date reaches this date, the system resets the Payment field to the remaining segment balance and resets the Payment Type field to (1) Level Principal.

\n
\nUsing PowerOn specfiles, you can generate notices based on the Balloon Date to notify members of upcoming due dates for balloon payments.
\n
\nIf you pull this value from a loan calculation, the system updates this field with the value in the Balloon Date field of the Loan Calc screen.

\n#### Data Type Descriptions
\n##### (0) Daily 365 Day Interest
\n   Calculates segment interest on a 365-day basis. The system calculates interest as follows:
\n       - Interest Rate รท 365 x Segment Balance x the number of days since the Interest Date.
\n##### (2) Daily 365.25 Day Interest
\n   Calculates segment interest on a 365.25-day basis. The system calculates interest as follows:
\n       - Interest Rate รท 365.25 x Segment Balance x the number of days since the Interest Date.
\n##### (3) Daily Billed Interest I
\n   Calculates segment interest on an interest-only loan. This interest type is valid only for interest-only loans. The system calculates interest as follows:
\n       - Interest Rate / 365 x Segment Balance x number of days since the Interest Date.
\n       - For segments with an Interest Type of (3) Daily Billed Interest I the following changes occur:
\n       - The system puts this amount of interest in the Int Unpaid Billed field.
\n       - The system places this interest amount, less any delinquent interest amount, in the Payment field.
\n       - The system adjusts the Payment Bucket fields accordingly.
\n       - The system subtracts any interest payments from the Int Unpaid Billed field, until it reaches 0.00 (zero), after which it applies any further payments to Billed Fee Unpaid and then to principal, even if there is additional accrued interest.
\n       - When the system date has reached the balloon date, Daily Posting automatically sets the segment's Interest Type field to (0) Daily 365 Day Interest, the Payment Type field to (1) Level Principal, and the Payment field to the segment balance. This causes the entire segment balance plus all accrued interest to become due and payable on the Balloon Date.
\n       - Important: Daily billed interest loans of this type must have the following fields set as specified:
\n       - The Interest Type field in the Segment record must be set to (3) Daily Billed Interest I.
\n       - The Payment Type field in the Segment record must be set to (0) Level Payment. This differs from other interest-only loans, which are set to (1) Level Principal.
\n       - The Payment Frequency field in the Loan record must be set to (4) Monthly.
\n       - The Due Date Advance Code field in the Loan record must be set to (0) Use Max Due Date Advance Period with the Max Due Date Advance Period set to 1.
\n       - The DQ Calculation Method field in the Loan record must be set to (1) Payment Buckets Are Calculated Monthly.
\n       - The Balloon Date field in the Segment record must be set to the date the loan is to be paid off. Since these loans are interest-only loans, there must be a balloon date.
\n       - The Due Date field for all daily billed loans must be the same
\n##### (4) Daily Billed Interest II
\n   Calculates interest-only loans.   Important: This interest type is functionally identical to (3) Daily Billed Interest I. It lets credit unions support daily billed interest loans with an alternate due date (for example, all Daily Billed Interest I loans can be due on the 15th of every month, and Daily Billed Interest II loans can all be due on the 20th). Each type has its own statement cutoff options.

\n   Uses a fixed rate for interest calculations. The system uses the Interest Rate or the calculation defined in the Interest Type Definitions parameters to calculate the interest on the segment.##### 1โ99
\n   Credit union-defined index code used for variable rate segments. You can use the rate index to specify the base rate and frequency of changes for variable rate segments.
\n   
\n       - These codes are for your information only. You cannot store the actual base rate in the Loan record. Instead, you specify the current base rate when you run the Rate Change Processing batch program using option (2) Select by Interest Rate Index for loans with the specified Interest Rate Index.
\nRate Change Processing then calculates the new interest rate for the segments as described below:
\n   - Adds the Interest Rate Margin field value to the base rate
\n   - Adds the Risk Rate field value
\n   - Subtracts the Discount Rate field value
\n   - If necessary, adjusts the calculated interest rate as follows:
\n   - If the calculated rate is less than the Interest Rate Minimum field value, the Interest Rate Minimum becomes the interest rate.
\n   - If the calculated rate is greater than the Interest Rate Maximum field value, the Interest Rate Maximum becomes the interest rate.
\n   - If the calculated rate is greater than the Periodic Cap Start Rate field value plus the Periodic Cap field value, the sum of the Periodic Cap Start Rate field value and the Periodic Cap field value becomes the interest rate.
\n   - Stores the resulting rate in the Interest Rate field in the Segment record
\n
\nFor example, if you specify an Interest Rate Margin field value of 3.500%, the system adds 3.5% to the base rate for the index to determine the Interest Rate amount.

\n
\nWhen you run the Rate Change Processing batch program, the system updates this field with either the Original Date field value of the segment or the last anniversary of the Original Date. Rate Change Processing then checks this date to verify that the interest rate has not already increased (or decreased) by the specified Periodic Cap.
\n
\nFor example, if the Original Segment Date is 06/12/20, and you run Rate Change Processing on 10/12/21, the system changes the Periodic Cap Start Date to 06/12/21. If you run Rate Change Processing again on 01/15/22, the system does not increase the interest rate for the segment if the current rate is equal to the Periodic Cap Start Rate field value plus the Periodic Cap field value.

For example, if you want to calculate the payment on a $10,000 loan so that the final balloon payment, due in 36 months, is $5,000, simply enter $5,000 in this field.
\n
\nIf you specify (2) Calculate Loan Term for the calculation type on the Loan Calc screen, the system ignores the value in this field.
\n
\nIf you pull this value from a loan calculation, the system updates this field with the value in the Balloon Amount field of the Loan Calc screen.

\nYou can update this field manually, or the system can calculate the segment payment amount based on the Loan Code field value in the Loan record, the Payment Type and Balloon Date fields in the Segment record, and the parameters set with the Payment Calculation Types parameters.
\n
\nThe system adjusts the Payment field in the Loan record any time the user updates the Payment fields in the associated Segment records.
\n
\nIf the system computes the payment, it assumes the payment is monthly unless you specify otherwise with the Payment Frequency Adjustment parameter in the Payment Calculation Types parameters. You can use this parameter to change the computed monthly payment to match the Payment Frequency field in the Loan record.
\n
\nYou can compute the payment amount using Projections, or by running the Rate Change Processing batch program. For more information on how the payment type affects the segment payment, see the Payment Type field.

\n### Partial Payment
\nThis field contains the partial payment amount that applies to the segment.

\nDefault Control      **No**
\nDefault Value **0.00**
\n
\nThis field is calculated in the same way as the Partial Payment field in the Loan record, except that it applies only to this segment. The Loan record's Partial Payment field is the total of all the Segment records associated with the loan.
\n
\nThe Partial Payment field in the Segment record can contain the entire payment due amount for the segment if the entire segment amount due has been paid, but the payment did not cover all the segments in the loan. The field is not cleared (to 0.00) until the loan payment is made in full, resulting in advancing the due date for the loan.
\n
\nWhen you perform a single segment transaction on a delinquent loan, the Partial Payment field in the Segment record can contain several payment amounts, up to the maximum loan due date at time of transaction. As the loan due date advances, the system reduces the payment amount portion for the segment from the Partial Payment field.
\n
\nIf you perform file maintenance on this field, the system also updates the corresponding Partial Payment field in the Loan record, which stores the total for all the segments.
\nFor non-SymChoice loans, any time a payment is posted to a loan, the system also posts a comment providing the partial payment field value before and after the associated loan payment:
\n   - % PartialPmt xxx.xx to xxx.xx
\n   - The % comment prints if either the previous or current partial payment amount is not equal to $0.00.
\n
\nFor SymChoice loans, the comments are posted per segment record such as:
\n***Important:***  If the loan Due Date field value is equal to the Max Loan Due Date Loan field, the Partial Payment field is set to $0.00.
\n
\nThese comments are suppressed on receipts and statements, but display and print in member history and online banking.
\n
\nThe % comments are used to automatically repopulate the Partial Payment field when a payment is voided. If you do a payment adjustment, you can use this field to update the Partial Payment field manually.

\n### Pmt Bucket Amt 1 - Pmt Bucket Amt 8
\nThe eight Pmt Bucket Amt fields store a history of payment amounts for the segment, each due on the effective date specified in the corresponding Pmt Bucket Due Date field in the Loan record.

\nAny time a new payment bucket is created for any segment, the system also creates a corresponding payment bucket for every segment associated with the loan. In this way, the payment buckets for all segments (and the loan) are kept in sync with the bucket dates and with each other.
\n
\nIf you update any of these fields, the system also updates the corresponding Pmt Bucket Amt 1โ8 fields in the Loan record, which store the totals for all the segments.
